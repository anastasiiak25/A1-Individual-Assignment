       " 'title': 'Unionizing your store: A how to guide',\n",
       " 'text': \"Hey everyone! \\n\\nI’ve been on this subreddit for a while and it seems like every day now we’re getting 3 types of posts. 1) New store unionizing!! 2) Peeps asking about unionizing and how to begin. Or 3) comments on horror stories telling the op to unionize.\\n\\nI’m an organizer at one of the newer stores to have filed to unionize, and I want to share with you the very broad strokes of how we got the ball rolling. The whole idea seemed so nebulous and scary at first, but once you have your partners on board, it’s actually surprisingly easy to start. I hope that sharing my experience will make the whole thing less intimidating.\\n\\nAlso: you may have your opinions on whether or not Unionizing is right for you. This post isn’t really about that conversation. This is just to help people who DO want to unionize figure out where to start. Please be nice.\\n\\n**Step one: Reach out.**\\n\\nNo seriously. If you are even thinking about wanting to unionize, reach out to Starbucks Workers United. They’re on twitter u/SBWorkersUnited and you can even email sbworkersunited@gmail.com to get some advice at any stage. Likely there’s a store close to you that’s already organizing that they can put you in contact with. I’ve spoken with partners from four stores in the past couple of months and helped to answer questions and I know other stores are doing the same.\\n\\nSWU also has materials that are very useful tools. They have stuff for talking points with partners who may be on the fence. They have insights into tactics that corporate is using to bust the unions. They have a lot of very helpful and empowering information that they are more than willing to give to you.\\n\\n**Step two: Talk to your partners.**\\n\\nThis step is really the most important step. The rest is just paperwork. The whole point of a union is to band together with your coworkers to negotiate to make your workplace better. Start with one person you trust and agrees with you and build from there. I was really lucky with my store and everyone was basically just waiting for someone to hand them a union card. Once I realized that, I sent an email. I know everyone’s stores can be different. Some people are aggressively anti-union and some people might simply not see the point. It really depends on your situation as to what you should do here.\\n\\nI recommend getting 3 or 4 of your partners at least who are willing to help you organize. At my store, the 4 of us just shared a group text message where we discussed everything. This helps spread the workload around so no one gets overwhelmed – or when someone does, they can pull back and rely on the others to fill in. Try to get a person who represents each day part as well. At the stores we’ve been talking to, a lot of the night crew is hella on board already probably because managers are rarely there, so they have more unsupervised time to talk about things.\\n\\nBE CAREFUL. At this stage you’re vulnerable so you’ll have to be strategic. Have a narc for a ssv? Try talking to your baristas after you get off or outside of work. Ssv’s on your side but your SM is a devil? Talk to each other on the weekends when they’re not there. It’s a bit easier to bring up unions now. I asked a lot of “what do you think about what happened in Buffalo?” to gauge the level of interest.\\n\\nAnd of course, if you ever feel like you don’t know what to do next, circle back to step one. There are a lot of us who are invested in helping each other. Whether that’s a zoom call, a text, or a “you can do it!”\\n\\nOnce you have most of your store on board, continue to step three.\\n\\n**Step Three:** **Seriously, contact Starbucks Workers United.**\\n\\nI’m listing this as a step three because this was actually my step two. (Whoops). I waited until literally my whole store was ready before I ever reached out. So, if you’re like me and have skipped step one, this is when you’ll 100% have to reach out. SWU will provide you with materials you may be missing and walk you through the next few steps.\\n\\n**Step Four: Gather signatures.**\\n\\nWorkers United will send you the pdf to the cards to hand to your coworkers. Technically you only need \\\\~30% of your store to sign to file. But I'd recommend getting as many people as you can to sign. Starbucks will launch a huge anti-union campaign once you file and you want as many people aware of what’s going as possible. A big part of union busting is to create division on your team, so you’ll want as many people on your side as possible.\\n\\n**Step Five: Create a group chat.**\\n\\nYou may notice a common theme here, and it’s communicating to your partners. A LOT. Lol. At this point my store created a group chat with everyone who’d signed cards. This way we’d be able to share everything with everyone as soon as we knew. The closer we are, the harder it is to divide us.\\n\\nStep Six: Write your letters and file.\\n\\nYou’ll have to write your petition to the NLRB and a letter to Kevin Johnson. You’ll also have to scan your cards and submit the actual documents to the NLRB. It’s okay if you don’t know wtf to do. We asked a million questions over and over throughout this process. I’m still not entirely sure if my partner emailed Kevin Johnson directly or went through Workers United. *I guess the point I’m trying to make is that these steps can sound intimidating, but you’ll have people holding your hand through the whole thing if you need it.*\\n\\n**Aftermath:**\\n\\nYay you’ve filed!! Now what? You’ll let the world know you’ve filed. You now have legal protection as well as the protection of public opinion. If Starbucks does something dodgy, you have ways to hold them accountable.\\n\\nAt work there’ll be a whole lot of nothing for a few days except a grumpy store manager. But then expect visits from DM’s and Regional Directors asking how they can support you (technically illegal after filing but whatever). You’ll get emails from them as well as new signs in the back. Take pictures of everything. I literally send everything they post to our lawyer. Outside of work, you’ll likely have hella interviews with local news stations because this is a big deal. *Again, don’t be too freaked out by this.* You’ll be walked through some media training. And if interviews aren’t really your thing, find someone who’s comfortable with it. Make it fun! The whole point of a Union is to have a team of coworkers on your side.\\n\\nThat’s all I have right now. But I know from being online and seeing what they’ve done in Buffalo that we have tons of captive audience meetings and stuff ahead of us. It’ll be annoying but knowing there is an end to this makes it a bit easier. My tip to you is to prepare your people for what they’re getting into from the jump. The more you know going in, the less likely you'll be caught off guard when the bs starts. I will say that the more stores that file (and there are so so many coming soon) the harder it will be for corporate to launch full scale attacks like in Buffalo. Things may very well get easier as more of us move to unionize. There’s more of us than there are of them. And that’s what scares corporate so much.\\n\\nI know work has been hell for a lot of us recently. I know unions are a controversial topic. But if you’ll indulge my soapbox moment, I think that we are living through a time that could completely change how our labor is valued. It’s bigger than your single store, it’s bigger than this company.\\n\\nThis is the most excited I’ve felt about working at Starbucks in over half a decade and it’s because the people I work with are coming together and fighting for each other.\\n\\nAnnnnnyway. I’ll get down off this soapbox. Hopefully this was educational. Hopefully this made the whole process seem less scary. Hopefully it inspired a few of you to start the process at your stores. Maybe you just found it interesting.\\n\\nIf you need any more info or contact information, feel free to DM me! I’ll do my best to respond to you all.\\n\\nSolidarity!\",\n",

Like I know after negotiations there will be a contract that likely will provide for better working conditions and pay, but like do things seem mostly the same or is there a big shift in how it feels at work? Like are schedules the same right after unionizing as they were before the vote, do they stay generally the same after there's a contract? Or are they getting rapidly changed around?  \\nDo you usually keep the same store manager or do they like to swap out someone different? Do they try and bring in different Shift Supervisors or anything?   \\n\\n\\nIs there a different vibe at all? Between coworkers? between partners and management? For instance on my store I feel like everyone is super friendly and gets along well, including with the assistant manager and manager. There's like one or two SSVs that are a bit intense, but most people still generally like them because as people they're great, they're just a bit much as bosses.  \\nDid business change at all? Like in terms of busyness or anything? Maybe more busy cuz more people are supporting the store's efforts? Maybe less busy cuz Starbucks is rich and probably has ways to try and motivate customers towards other stores to try and drive down sales at a union store? idk maybe that's fake but I could see something like that happening.  \\n\\n\\nJust overall, how different is it work at a place that isn't just unionized, like going from a non union job to a union one.

I'm located in Minnesota if it makes a difference, but when I was in the postal union, they never did anything for us. Not even the regular carriers, I was working 60 hour weeks, 10 and 12 hour days, 6 day weeks, no time off, and then even if you become a 'full' carrier you still got treated poorly. I was berated by coworkers and management, and unfortunately unions make it really hard to get rid of people who are causing a lot of issues and/or half assing or not doing their jobs. Another carrier (woman) at the post office got sexually harrassed by a regular carrier (a man) and our female union steward laughed in her face about it. I paid union dues and was still treated incredibly poorly, and I was sent to other stations constantly and given loads of extra work. I understand it wouldn't quite be the same if we unionize here, but I think you can understand my hesitance.\\n\\nFrom my point of view, fighting for better pay I absolutely agree with, but unionizing could completely wipe out the benefits we already have, and it could get way worse than it is. Baristas should be making more than minimum wage because it does take skill to make the drinks and do everything they do. I'm just not convinced from my own experiences that unionizing is the way to do it. \\n\\nHowever, I'm sure a lot of you are smarter than I am and have good reasons for it and I would love to hear them, I am interested in this, I'm just not completely swayed\",\n",

I make $11 now, after two years with the company, and an increase to $15 is highly appealing. If unions fail in negotiating, staying at $11 seems like a huge risk.\\n\\nWill unions make the workplace better? Starbucks is a tough job because we are rushing to make drive through times an average of 45 seconds per order during peak, and sometimes I’m running from one side of the store to the other in an attempt to make these times a reality. We are also understaffed and I sometimes have to handle the ovens, while handling the register, and also make drinks simultaneously. \\n\\nWill unions make this all just go away?

       "  'text': \"Hey everyone! \\n\\nI’ve been on this subreddit for a while and it seems like every day now we’re getting 3 types of posts. 1) New store unionizing!! 2) Peeps asking about unionizing and how to begin. Or 3) comments on horror stories telling the op to unionize.\\n\\nI’m an organizer at one of the newer stores to have filed to unionize, and I want to share with you the very broad strokes of how we got the ball rolling. The whole idea seemed so nebulous and scary at first, but once you have your partners on board, it’s actually surprisingly easy to start. I hope that sharing my experience will make the whole thing less intimidating.\\n\\nAlso: you may have your opinions on whether or not Unionizing is right for you. This post isn’t really about that conversation. This is just to help people who DO want to unionize figure out where to start. Please be nice.\\n\\n**Step one: Reach out.**\\n\\nNo seriously. If you are even thinking about wanting to unionize, reach out to Starbucks Workers United. They’re on twitter u/SBWorkersUnited and you can even email sbworkersunited@gmail.com to get some advice at any stage. Likely there’s a store close to you that’s already organizing that they can put you in contact with. I’ve spoken with partners from four stores in the past couple of months and helped to answer questions and I know other stores are doing the same.\\n\\nSWU also has materials that are very useful tools. They have stuff for talking points with partners who may be on the fence. They have insights into tactics that corporate is using to bust the unions. They have a lot of very helpful and empowering information that they are more than willing to give to you.\\n\\n**Step two: Talk to your partners.**\\n\\nThis step is really the most important step. The rest is just paperwork. The whole point of a union is to band together with your coworkers to negotiate to make your workplace better. Start with one person you trust and agrees with you and build from there. I was really lucky with my store and everyone was basically just waiting for someone to hand them a union card. Once I realized that, I sent an email. I know everyone’s stores can be different. Some people are aggressively anti-union and some people might simply not see the point. It really depends on your situation as to what you should do here.\\n\\nI recommend getting 3 or 4 of your partners at least who are willing to help you organize. At my store, the 4 of us just shared a group text message where we discussed everything. This helps spread the workload around so no one gets overwhelmed – or when someone does, they can pull back and rely on the others to fill in. Try to get a person who represents each day part as well. At the stores we’ve been talking to, a lot of the night crew is hella on board already probably because managers are rarely there, so they have more unsupervised time to talk about things.\\n\\nBE CAREFUL. At this stage you’re vulnerable so you’ll have to be strategic. Have a narc for a ssv? Try talking to your baristas after you get off or outside of work. Ssv’s on your side but your SM is a devil? Talk to each other on the weekends when they’re not there. It’s a bit easier to bring up unions now. I asked a lot of “what do you think about what happened in Buffalo?” to gauge the level of interest.\\n\\nAnd of course, if you ever feel like you don’t know what to do next, circle back to step one. There are a lot of us who are invested in helping each other. Whether that’s a zoom call, a text, or a “you can do it!”\\n\\nOnce you have most of your store on board, continue to step three.\\n\\n**Step Three:** **Seriously, contact Starbucks Workers United.**\\n\\nI’m listing this as a step three because this was actually my step two. (Whoops). I waited until literally my whole store was ready before I ever reached out. So, if you’re like me and have skipped step one, this is when you’ll 100% have to reach out. SWU will provide you with materials you may be missing and walk you through the next few steps.\\n\\n**Step Four: Gather signatures.**\\n\\nWorkers United will send you the pdf to the cards to hand to your coworkers. Technically you only need \\\\~30% of your store to sign to file. But I'd recommend getting as many people as you can to sign. Starbucks will launch a huge anti-union campaign once you file and you want as many people aware of what’s going as possible. A big part of union busting is to create division on your team, so you’ll want as many people on your side as possible.\\n\\n**Step Five: Create a group chat.**\\n\\nYou may notice a common theme here, and it’s communicating to your partners. A LOT. Lol. At this point my store created a group chat with everyone who’d signed cards. This way we’d be able to share everything with everyone as soon as we knew. The closer we are, the harder it is to divide us.\\n\\nStep Six: Write your letters and file.\\n\\nYou’ll have to write your petition to the NLRB and a letter to Kevin Johnson. You’ll also have to scan your cards and submit the actual documents to the NLRB. It’s okay if you don’t know wtf to do. We asked a million questions over and over throughout this process. I’m still not entirely sure if my partner emailed Kevin Johnson directly or went through Workers United. *I guess the point I’m trying to make is that these steps can sound intimidating, but you’ll have people holding your hand through the whole thing if you need it.*\\n\\n**Aftermath:**\\n\\nYay you’ve filed!! Now what? You’ll let the world know you’ve filed. You now have legal protection as well as the protection of public opinion. If Starbucks does something dodgy, you have ways to hold them accountable.\\n\\nAt work there’ll be a whole lot of nothing for a few days except a grumpy store manager. But then expect visits from DM’s and Regional Directors asking how they can support you (technically illegal after filing but whatever). You’ll get emails from them as well as new signs in the back. Take pictures of everything. I literally send everything they post to our lawyer. Outside of work, you’ll likely have hella interviews with local news stations because this is a big deal. *Again, don’t be too freaked out by this.* You’ll be walked through some media training. And if interviews aren’t really your thing, find someone who’s comfortable with it. Make it fun! The whole point of a Union is to have a team of coworkers on your side.\\n\\nThat’s all I have right now. But I know from being online and seeing what they’ve done in Buffalo that we have tons of captive audience meetings and stuff ahead of us. It’ll be annoying but knowing there is an end to this makes it a bit easier. My tip to you is to prepare your people for what they’re getting into from the jump. The more you know going in, the less likely you'll be caught off guard when the bs starts. I will say that the more stores that file (and there are so so many coming soon) the harder it will be for corporate to launch full scale attacks like in Buffalo. Things may very well get easier as more of us move to unionize. There’s more of us than there are of them. And that’s what scares corporate so much.\\n\\nI know work has been hell for a lot of us recently. I know unions are a controversial topic. But if you’ll indulge my soapbox moment, I think that we are living through a time that could completely change how our labor is valued. It’s bigger than your single store, it’s bigger than this company.\\n\\nThis is the most excited I’ve felt about working at Starbucks in over half a decade and it’s because the people I work with are coming together and fighting for each other.\\n\\nAnnnnnyway. I’ll get down off this soapbox. Hopefully this was educational. Hopefully this made the whole process seem less scary. Hopefully it inspired a few of you to start the process at your stores. Maybe you just found it interesting.\\n\\nIf you need any more info or contact information, feel free to DM me! I’ll do my best to respond to you all.\\n\\nSolidarity!\",\n",

Or are they getting rapidly changed around?  \\nDo you usually keep the same store manager or do they like to swap out someone different? Do they try and bring in different Shift Supervisors or anything?   \\n\\n\\nIs there a different vibe at all? Between coworkers? between partners and management? For instance on my store I feel like everyone is super friendly and gets along well, including with the assistant manager and manager. There's like one or two SSVs that are a bit intense, but most people still generally like them because as people they're great, they're just a bit much as bosses.  \\nDid business change at all? Like in terms of busyness or anything? Maybe more busy cuz more people are supporting the store's efforts? Maybe less busy cuz Starbucks is rich and probably has ways to try and motivate customers towards other stores to try and drive down sales at a union store? idk maybe that's fake but I could see something like that happening.  \\n\\n\\nJust overall, how different is it work at a place that isn't just unionized, like going from a non union job to a union one. But being in the same job at the same location, but now there's a union. How much is it noticeable on the day to day?  \\n\\n\\nIs there anything you observe at other stores that makes you thankful or take note of having the union?

I'm located in Minnesota if it makes a difference, but when I was in the postal union, they never did anything for us. Not even the regular carriers, I was working 60 hour weeks, 10 and 12 hour days, 6 day weeks, no time off, and then even if you become a 'full' carrier you still got treated poorly. I was berated by coworkers and management, and unfortunately unions make it really hard to get rid of people who are causing a lot of issues and/or half assing or not doing their jobs. Another carrier (woman) at the post office got sexually harrassed by a regular carrier (a man) and our female union steward laughed in her face about it. I paid union dues and was still treated incredibly poorly, and I was sent to other stations constantly and given loads of extra work. I understand it wouldn't quite be the same if we unionize here, but I think you can understand my hesitance.\\n\\nFrom my point of view, fighting for better pay I absolutely agree with, but unionizing could completely wipe out the benefits we already have, and it could get way worse than it is. Baristas should be making more than minimum wage because it does take skill to make the drinks and do everything they do. I'm just not convinced from my own experiences that unionizing is the way to do it. \\n\\nHowever, I'm sure a lot of you are smarter than I am and have good reasons for it and I would love to hear them, I am interested in this, I'm just not completely swayed\",\n",

I make $11 now, after two years with the company, and an increase to $15 is highly appealing. If unions fail in negotiating, staying at $11 seems like a huge risk.\\n\\nWill unions make the workplace better? Starbucks is a tough job because we are rushing to make drive through times an average of 45 seconds per order during peak, and sometimes I’m running from one side of the store to the other in an attempt to make these times a reality. We are also understaffed and I sometimes have to handle the ovens, while handling the register, and also make drinks simultaneously. \\n\\nWill unions make this all just go away? Will unions make Starbucks a job you can support a family with and buy a house?

A union gives you legal backing to say \"uh no, and if I\\'m going to get in trouble for saying no, I want my union rep to be a part of that conversation.\" No contract needed, forming a union immediately gives you that.',\n",

       "   \"With our store, we kept it just between the baristas and shifts until we filed. We were lucky and had everyone but one partner totally in favor of it. Once we filed, our DM and SM knew almost immediately and were pretty pissy about it. We're almost to our election date and while things have been annoying, it's been pretty manageable. I've definitely had worse experiences with managers and not gotten a union out of it. Haha\\n\\nBut I'm also in a very pro-union area. I can understand being in a redder state and having to worry.\\n\\nIf you're interested and think others at your store might be, I'd still recommend reaching out to Starbucks Workers United. There may be other stores in your area that are also looking to organize and having several stores in a district file at once would do a lot to keep the retaliations to a minimum since managers would have to focus on more than one store.\",\n",
       "   'Union dues and fees all depend on the union itself and are typically voted on by the members. Unions are democratic by nature (not necessarily in the political sense but in the sense that everything is voted on by its own members. In my union, my dues are $1.80 + 1.25% of my non-overtime pay monthly. $68 a month or so. I am also getting raises every 6 months per my contract of about $1.00 plus an annual cost of living increase of 2-5% as well as guaranteed benefits, retirement, PTO minimums, overtime rules (first 50 hrs of the year are time and a half, any OT after that for the rest of the year is double time. Paid travel time and mileage if I have to work off site, guaranteed number of hours, required minimum notice to change my shift, required amount of rest time between shifts, etc. the amount I pay more than pays for itself in the benefits I get. \\n\\nEach union will have its own dues structure set up and voted on by its own members. This is typically included in either their own constitution or bylaws of each chapter/local.',\n",
